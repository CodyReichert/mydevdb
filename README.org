* mydevdb

=mydevdb= is a bash script for creating mysql databases and users.
The purpose is to quickly put up new environments on the fly, without needing
to log into the mysql console. This should really only be used in development.

** Usage

The first argument will always be the user that has privileges to create/delete db's and users,

Create a new user/database combo. Privileges will be given to the new user on the new 
database, and the user's password will be the same as the user/db name.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        λ mydevdb root testdb
    #+END_SRC

To delete the =testdb= user and database we just created, run it with the =-d= flag.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        λ mydevdb root -d testdb
    #+END_SRC

To login directly to the mysql console of =testdb=:

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        λ mydevdb -l testdb
    #+END_SRC
